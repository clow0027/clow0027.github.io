            Laura has a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from McGill University. After four magnificent years of living in Montreal, Quebec, and studying the wonders of the human mind, she decided it was time to feed her creative soul. After finding the IMD program at Algonquin, Laura moved back to her hometown of Ottawa, Ontario, to continue her journey of growth. She is the 3<sup>rd</sup> child of two loving parents who support her as she spreads her wings. Laura values growth in every stage of life and loves to travel, expose herself to new experiences, and meet new people. In her spare time, Laura loves to laugh with loved ones, paint, read, hike, and feel the sun on her skin.
